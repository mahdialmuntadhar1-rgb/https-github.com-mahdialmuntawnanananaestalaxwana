# Iraq Compass (Supabase-only)

Iraq Compass is a production-focused Iraq business directory app that uses **Supabase as the only backend**.

## What this app includes

- Supabase Auth integration (Google OAuth + profile sync)
- Supabase-backed business directory listings
- Supabase-backed featured businesses, events, stories, deals, and postcards
- Owner/admin dashboard with profile updates, post publishing, and postcard ingestion
- Multilingual UI (English, Arabic, Kurdish)

## Backend policy

- Firebase is not used.
- Mock/demo business datasets are not used in the production data flow.
- App data reads/writes go through Supabase tables in `supabase/migrations/20260328_bootstrap_public_tables.sql`.
